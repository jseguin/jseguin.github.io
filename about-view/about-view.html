      <p>Hello, I’m Jonathan Séguin, a creative coder and technological tinkerer passionate about building and designing incredible interactive experiences.</p>

      <p>As a recent graduate of Ryerson University’s New Media BFA program, I am seeking to collaborate with brilliant new teammates in an environment that will foster creativity and present exciting challenges for professional and technical growth.</p>

      <p>Having been programming for the last 10 years, I have developed a diverse set of skills and creative experience. Each project I work on has different requirements and a set of tools that are best suited for the job. Whether it be exploring how sound can be experienced spatially using Kinect, developing stunning visual effects using Processing or implementing responsive frontends for the mobile web, I have adapted the task at hand. When I commit to any project, I am committed to producing excellence and seeing the vision through – learning new technologies is just a natural part of the process.</p>

      <h3>Philosophy</h3>

      <p>I have always been fascinated with the technology I work with, however these tools are simply a means to an end. It is what those tools have allowed creators to make that is my true passion: video games, art, animation, gadgets, and culture. All of the experiences with the things I love have left me with a moment of discovery and a consequent moment of awe. When I take on a project, the first thing I try to do is identify why I want to create what I am creating. By working with conviction, the things that I produce will be able to communicate that same moment of discovery and awe that inspired me to create in the first place.</p>

      <h3>What I am looking for</h3>

      <p>I am looking to build amazing things with amazing people. That means collaborating with a team of creative, design-minded individuals who are working on exciting and creatively challenging projects. I am seeking a team culture that encourages experimentation and input. Lastly, whether it be a studio, company, or agency I wish to work with those who are clearly committed to working on meaningful initiatives. </p>
