<hr>
<p>Generic Lava Platformer 5000 was conceived as a final project during my first year at Ryerson University. The object of the game is to keep yourself out of the lava as long as possible by jumping from platform to platform. Platforms fall slowly from the top of the screen, however as the game progresses platforms fall much more rapidly, as well as shrink in size making it increasingly difficult to land safely.</p>
