<p>One day my buddy Nick and I were chit chatting about project ideas and he said to me “maaaan wouldn’t it be cool if you could play Pong on a t-shirt?” I propped up and said “Yeah dude! That’d be totally rad!”, and so we set out to make it a reality.</p>

<p>After doing some shopping at some local electronics stores and a Home Hardware, we managed to scrounge up the parts we needed for a prototype. We purchased two small black plastic boxes, some really cool looking retro knobs, telephone wire, two buttons, a handful of jumper cables, two potentiometers and an LED matrix.</p>

<p>Nick came up with a cool design for the shirt, and as two grown men who aren’t very good at sewing, we found a way to iron on an Atari logo.</p>

<p>One of the coolest parts of the shirt I thought was the assembly of the controllers. We drilled holes into the black boxes and embedded the buttons and potentiometers we had picked up. After stripping the ends of our telephone cable, I soldered the wires to the buttons and potentiometers. The other end of the telephone cable was stripped and turned into a makeshift serial cable which connected to the Arduino, which listened for button presses and the turning of the knobs. After some final touches, we had a fully (well mostly) functional prototype Pong shirt!</p>

<p>For a more polished version in the future there are many improvements I can think of. Instead of using a full fledged Arduino, a Lilypad, which is discrete and perfect for wearables, would be a better solution. In place of actual wires, conductive thread can be sewn directly into the shirt itself, which would make it much easier to wear. Lastly, the LED matrix can also be replaced with very small micro LEDs that could be sewn into the shirt as well, perhaps behind a layer of fabric that resembles a screen.</p>
