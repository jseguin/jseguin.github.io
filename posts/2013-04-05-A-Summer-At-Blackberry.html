<p>This past summer I had the exhilarating experience of working at Blackberry. I say <em>exhilarating</em>, because when I entered the company they were in the midst of a massive transition: I was dropped into the storm of development around their new Blackberry 10 operating system. The speed at which this product was being built was incredible and I was placed on a team of brilliant engineers working on perhaps the most cutting edge mobile web browser around.</p>

<p>I was tasked with working on Blackberry’s version of JQuery Mobile for their web platform. JQuery Mobile provides a cross-platform solution to build responsive mobile applications and websites using a declarative style that allows for rapid development.</p>

<p>Blackberry’s version takes JQuery Mobile and restyles all the existing widgets to look and behave like native Blackberry 10 UI. In addition it adds custom widgets for Blackberry 10 UI elements that are not present in JQuery Mobile.</p>

<p>What was really great about working on this project was that Blackberry 10’s browser has some of the best, if not <em>the best</em>, HTML5 support around (check out <a href="http://html5test.com/results/mobile.html">html5test</a> and you’ll see what I mean). This meant that I had free reign to experiment with and implement designs using the most cutting edge web technologies. Overall the experience was a great one and Blackberry 10 JQuery Mobile beta has been released on Blackberry’s Github and is open to contributions!</p>
