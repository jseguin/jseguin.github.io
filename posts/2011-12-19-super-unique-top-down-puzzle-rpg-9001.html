<p>TLDR;</p>
<p>Super Unique Top Down Puzzle RPG 9001 is a two player cooperative video game. However the game splits the visual and auditory components across the players: one player is given only visuals to interact with, while the other is given only audio. This creates two very different and distinct player experiences. The game is designed such that neither player can progress without working with the other. Since most games are easily played without sound, we wished to challenge that by making audio play an equally important role in our game.</p>
<p>Super Unique is currently more of a proof of concept and what is represented here is more of a technical demo of our progress.</p>

<p><strong>Artist Statement</strong></p>
<p><em><span>Super Unique Top Down Puzzle RPG 9001</span></em><span> is a multiplayer video game installation that requires two players to  cooperate while separated in physical and virtual space. Our work is  driven by the idea that every medium is traditionally limited by the  expected interaction it affords: for example, a video game carries the  expectation of being seen and heard simultaneously. These conditions are  similar in that either element is tied to one of the five senses – but  if these “expected” attributes were to be fragmented, how would the end  users cope with the changes? We plan to explore this “fragmentation of  the senses” by distributing the primary sensory outputs of traditional  video games across two very different playing experiences: one player  will see the game, and one player will hear the game. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span>Description</span></strong><br/><span>The  installation will be set up as a simple computer kiosk. The “seeing”  player will be able to view the game screen, as well as navigate the  player character through our visual environment using keyboard controls.  The “hearing” player will have a set of headphones, attached to the  same computer, as well as the ability to explore the game’s soundscape  using a rotating potentiometer. The players must act together to ensure  their character survives and escapes the dungeon he has been situated in  by communicating to each other. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>While most games can arguably be navigated  through and enjoyed with the sound turned off (relying heavily on visual  feedback), we are designing <em>Super Unique</em> so that the seeing  player is reliant on the proactive communication of the hearing player.  Visual players are first handicapped in that there will be a spotlight  with a small radius surrounding the hero, creating a limited vision of  the game space. Many traps and puzzles will be set up that communicate  strictly aural signals, meaning visual players must consult with their  hearing teammates to avoid landmines and pits, as well as to locate  hidden platforms, switches and paths. Hearing players can “tune in” to  sounds by turning a potentiometer. The visual player can see an arrow on  screen that corresponds to the area the hearing player has tuned in to,  allowing the visual player to pinpoint the location of any sound the  hearing player describes. The game is completed when the seeing player,  with the assistance of the hearing player, safely navigates to the final  room of the dungeon.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span>Conclusion</span></strong><br/><span>Our  system deconstructs what is expected of traditional video games by  compartmentalizing essential modes of communication that are typically  synchronized and unified (visuals and sound). In our efforts to  challenge the user’s expectations of media, we believe that video games  lend themselves to our experiment by naturally inviting user  participation. In an ever-changing technological society, it is  important to continuously challenge the limitations of the mediums we  use regularly; our project demonstrates this in an engaging and  challenging interactive experience.</span></p>
