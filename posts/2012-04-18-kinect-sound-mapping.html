<p>I had recently been working on creating a video game that split visual and auditory experiences into two. However, I quickly realized how terribly dull the audio experience was without visuals. If there's ever been a marriage that worked, it was the marriage between audio and video. I started to regret ever starting the project, because quite frankly being blind sucked. At that point I had a realization that my whole life had been lived visually and perhaps I needed to back up and approach the issue from a different perspective. I decided to do some research into the different ways I could create rich audio experiences.</p>
<p>As an ongoing project I hope to explore different methods of creating rich aural-spatial experiences. Currently, I am experimenting with Kinect and have created a rough prototype for mapping virtual sound sources to physical space. The goal of this experiment was to allow users to move freely through an environment, while simulating realistic 3D audio.</p>

<p>The prototype represents sound sources as cubes and the listener's head is represented by a green sphere. As the user moves their head through the environment, its position is tracked in 3D space by the kinect. This data allows openAL, the audio library, to simulate accurate panning, scaling of volume and gain, and direction of audio as if it were a binaural recording.</p>

<p>In testing the prototype I had a few interesting findings regarding user experience, content, and possible applications. To me this was purely a technical demo, so not much thought was put into the actual content conveyed. However when presenting the prototype before my peers, I noticed the content shaped their experience more so than the technology itself.</p>
<p>The audio track played was "Human" by Daft Punk. The track was split into three different layers of audio and spread in different locations throughout a room. I found that students were attracted to the most rhythmic of the tracks. So in moving through their space, students were selective with what they wanted to hear.</p>
<ul><li>This could have applications in games: providing a goal oriented environment where players seek certain audio "targets".</li>
<li>Another application would be to deliver personalized content to users, since each user can be delivered different audio.</li>
<li>Because students were jumping to and from different sound sources, a suggestion was also made to use the framework for dance environments â€“ since dance has both aural and spatial components.</li>
</ul><p>Another segment of students were focused on controlling their experience. It may have been mildly entertaining to use their bodies to control the panning of sounds and as a result that became an activity that was actively sought by many of the participants. This leads to the obvious use of the kinect as an interface for gestural sound control.</p>
<p>In an attempt to make the experience self explanatory, I decided to present it with accompanying visuals that served as a virtual map of where the sound sources were located. This was interesting for two reasons: users wanted to orient themselves on the map, but had great difficulty doing so. It would be interesting to re-conduct the experience without the use of visuals to see whether or not that changed the way the technology was engaged.</p>

<p>Lastly, changing the audio content would allow for many different applications. I love mystery novels, films, games, you name it, so one my interests with audio is identifying what it is, where it is, and why it exists. Recreating the scene of a murder or robbery through an audio space could provide a compelling experience for users who enjoy solving puzzles. By answering who, what, when, where and why in the context of audio and space allows for the recreation or conjuring of memories.</p>
