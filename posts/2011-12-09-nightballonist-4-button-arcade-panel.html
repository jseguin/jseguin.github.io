<p>Working with my great pal Konstantino, we built an arcade style button mashing controller for Miguel Sternberg at <a href="http://spookysquid.com/">SpookySquid Games</a>. The button box was built for a really fantastic arcade game <a href="http://spookysquid.com/nightballoonists/">The Night Ballonists</a> and was shown at the <a href="http://handeyesociety.com/event/social-11-feb-17th/">Hand Eye Society&#8217;s social #11</a>. The innards of the button box involved hacking an Xbox controller by soldering connections between the xbox PCB and the arcade buttons.</p>
