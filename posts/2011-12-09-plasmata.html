<p>Plasmata is a project that aims to create an educational environment through gameplay. Two iPads function as touchscreen inputs to manipulate colour selectors. Users can then grow "Plasmata" (coloured orbs), which they launch at the opposing user. In future development, Plasmata orbs will possess different properties based upon their colour and volume, and will introduce fast-paced strategic gameplay based on the interactions between Plasmata.</p>

<p><strong>Future Game Development</strong></p>
<ul><li>The game would function similar to air-hockey or pong, however involving the complexity of colour.</li>
<li>Each player has a rainbow coloured aura that acts as a colour selector and also marks the zone they must protect.</li>
<li>Players can prevent orbs from reaching their zone by launching and colliding their orbs with the incoming ones. This is called nullification.</li>
<li>To nullify an orb you must match, roughly, the size and hue of the opposing orb in order to nullify it.</li>
<li>Certain colours may respond differently upon a failed nullification. For instance red orbs may explode into several smaller orbs, green orbs may accelerate, yellow orbs might stop, but slow down other orbs within its range, etc.</li>
<li>Players may wish to nullify orbs, or purposely trigger their effects.</li>
</ul><p>The game then becomes a dilemma of which colours to utilize and how fast players can make those decisions. Underlying the gameplay would be elements of colour theory, complimentary colours, and colour mixing that would be acquired by playing the game.</p>
