<p>A few colleagues and I decided to enter our first official game jam at TOJam 2014. GOD HEAD!! is the game we managed to throw together in just under 48 hours. The game was programmed in C# and designed in the Unity Game engine. You can download a copy to play for yourself on PC or MAC from our itch.io page here <a href="http://teemyster.itch.io/-godhead_tojam">http://teemyster.itch.io/-godhead_tojam</a></p>

<p>In GOD HEAD!! the player plays as a giant robotic head (<em>our artist clearly has a thing for Gurran Lagann</em>) who must survive round after round of enemy hoards! We wanted to create a game that made the player feel powerful, however at the same time made them realize that no matter how powerful they are there is always vulnerability once they are out numbered. The object of GOD HEAD!! is to simply survive for as long as possible.</p>

<p>The player is a giant head for two reasons. It makes them feel massive in comparison to the enemies they face, however it also serves as a large target for enemy attack. This is part of the core mechanics of the game, as the player is also equipped with a shield that serves as both their method of attack and as a defense. Enemies attack by shooting projectiles and the player must block those attacks by rotating their shield into the correct defensive position.</p>

</div>

<p>The player has three modes of attack. All attacks cost a certain amount of <em>SP</em>, to prevent the player from spamming their most powerful attacks. <em>SP</em> will regenerate automatically, but at a fairly slow rate. The basic player attack thrusts the shield forwards and does damage to any enemies that it collides with. Dashing is the second mode of attack in the player's arsenal and serves as an escape mechanism for when the player is overwhelmed. When the player dashes they accelerate rapidly in one direction, knocking all enemies in their path out of the way. The third method of attack, and most powerful, is the playerâ€™s <em>final wave</em> attack, which unleashes a spiral of projectiles that will eliminate all enemies they touch.</p>

<p>Participating in TOJam was a wild experience. There were a lot of talented indie developers who made a bunch of truly quirky and hilarious games. While I did not sleep a wink, I would definitely do it again!</p>
