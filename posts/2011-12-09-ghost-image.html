<p>Ghost Image was a project I did that combined an implementation of two-dimensional <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaballs">metaballs</a>, projection and hardware control through the use of an arcade styled button panel. Participants controlled the colour and size of each metaball to create a vivid projected visualization.</p>

<p>The project was programmed in Processing and allows participants to create blobs called metaballs that behave similar to the lava in a lava lamp. Blobs merge together and separate in a gooey-like fashion.</p>

<p>Participants can create metaballs of difference sizes and colours by pressing a button of corresponding colour for a duration of time. The longer the button is held the bigger the metaball.</p>

<p>The arcade panel was created using an open source microcontroller, Arduino. The Arduino manages hardware input and outputs switch data to a laptop running the metaballs visualization in Processing.</p>
