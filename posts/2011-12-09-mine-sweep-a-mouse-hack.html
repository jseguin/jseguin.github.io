<p>Turn any dull room into a minefield full of exhilaration and imaginary lost limbs!</p>
<p>I created a small party game by embedding an optical mouse sensor into a  makeshift mine detector (broom stick + cardboard yay). With a bit of  software modification the mouse is able to track its position in a room of any size relative to a starting point in that room. Players navigate from one end of the room to the other trying to avoid stepping on mines.</p>

<p>This project was an assignment for one of my second year classes at Ryerson. The criteria for this assignment was to "hack" an optical mouse and repurpose its function. The idea I came up with was to use the optical mouse sensor as a mine detector. I felt the experience of walking through a minefield, where one false step could mean your end, created a very tense and exhilarating environment for play.</p>
<br/>
<p>The game functions as follows:</p>
<ul><li>Players navigate through a space with boundaries set in the form of a rectangle.</li>
<li>The goal is to make it from one end of the space to the other without running into any mines.</li>
<li>Players, however, are not given any visual cues to where the mines are planted. Originally the plan was to blindfold participants in order to have them focus on using their other senses (hearing).</li>
<li>As players approach a mine with their mine-detector, a beeping noise plays. The closer a player moves to a mine the faster the beeping sound.</li>
<li>By using the beeping sound, players should be able to navigate carefully to the other side without meeting their doom.</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally I decided it would be good for those observing to be able to monitor the situation more clearly, so they could see whether or not the contestant was poised for doom. Projected opposite the player is an overview of the player's position and mine positions. This actually created another form of feedback for the player to take heed of. The level of anxiety in the audience is directly expressed to the player as they move through the field giving them another way to gauge how well they're doing.</p>
<p>Of course this is yet again a very rough prototype and should I choose to resume work on it I would like to include much stronger visuals, audio and perhaps a timer to increase the player's anxiety.</p>
