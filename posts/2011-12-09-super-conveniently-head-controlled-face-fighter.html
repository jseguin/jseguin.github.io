<p>Pew pew pew! I've created a shoot 'em up game that you control with your face! I know, you're thinking, "That sounds rather unconventional and unnecessarily strange!" Well that's kind of the point. With Face Fighter I aimed to create a rift between game objectives and game controls. Players move their ship left to right by leaning or tilting their head. The object of the game is to survive as long as possible by avoiding oncoming asteroids and by racking up the highest score by shooting them. However, the act of <em>firin' your laser</em> is performed by players vigorously nodding their heads: this is risky because nodding diverts the player's focus away from the visuals of the screen. Consequently the game is as fun to watch as it is to play!</p>
